# Layout Gallery

A collection of three different CSS flexbox layouts with an interactive preview gallery.

## What's This?

Just experimenting with flexbox to create different layout patterns. Each layout uses nested flex containers to divide the space in various ways.

## Structure

```
├── index.html          # Gallery page
├── Layout1/           # First layout
├── Layout2/           # Second layout  
└── Layout3/           # Third layout
```

## How to View

Open `index.html` in a browser. Click any layout to see it full screen.

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS (flexbox only)
- No frameworks or JavaScript
